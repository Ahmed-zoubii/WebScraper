#### This is the *Web Scraper* project I made myself.

This project is a Python-based web scraper designed to extract and save articles of a specific type (e.g., "News") from the Nature website. The scraper allows users to specify the number of pages to scrape and the type of article to retrieve. It saves the content of each article in separate text files, organized by page number
